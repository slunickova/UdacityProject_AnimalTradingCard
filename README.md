# UdacityProject_AnimalTradingCard
This is my first project on Udacity Nanodegree program for Front End Developers.

I styled this Animal Trading Card with CSS.
Source of information for the text part was Wikipedia. The picture is from Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository (By Ashworth, James Hartley, 1874-1936; Ashworth, James Hartley [No restrictions], via Wikimedia Commons).
